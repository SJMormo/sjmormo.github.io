  <h2 class="mb-3">About Me</h2>
  
  <p>
    I am Mormo, a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) graduate from Rajshahi University of Engineering & 
    Technology (RUET), Bangladesh. My research interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural 
    Language Processing. I am currently seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. starting in Fall 2026.
  </p>

  <p>
    At present, I am working as a Research and Development Engineer at Shanghai Baud Data Communication Co., 
    Ltd. (BDCOM) in the Protocol II Department. My role involves designing and implementing new features, 
    as well as resolving issues in the Layer-3 Switch for the IPv4 module.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in competitive programming contests, which 
    significantly strengthened my problem-solving skills. I have also published a research paper titled 
    "An Ensemble Approach for Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition".
  </p>

  <p>
    My long-term research goal is to advance the development of intelligent systems that can learn, perceive, 
    and interact with the real world in a more robust and human-like manner, bridging the gap between theory and 
    practical applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    I consider myself a resilient, and self-motivated. I enjoy taking on new challenges and 
    continuously improving my skills. With curiosity and determination, I aim to grow as both a researcher and 
    an engineer.
